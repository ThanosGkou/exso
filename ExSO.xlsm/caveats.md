ExSO.xlsm is a macro-enabled, excel-based GUI aiming to facilitate broader accessibility of the power system and market operation data supported by **ExSO**.

Being a macro-enabled excel file, some security concerns may be raised which are worth addressing in this memo:

- The source vba code is provided in a plain [text format](https://github.com/ThanosGkou/exso/tree/main/ExSO.xlsm/ExSO.xlsm.txt)
- **The only outgoing traffic in the vba code relates to downloading Python 3.13.0**
- The only console commands issued by ExSO.xlsm relate to:
  - Building a virtual environment 
  - Installing exso
  - Using the exso command-line interface through convenient clicks and ticks.
